Pick-Up Hockey
==============
A project to buy, sell, and manage "spots" in a pick-up hockey session.

For years, my Friday Pick-Up Ice Hockey team has been managing the buy / sell list via email.  About a week before each skating session, the commissioner sends an email as the "buy / sell thread".  Regulars and substitutes add their names as a buyer or seller, like:

    Bill sells to Bob
    TBD sells to Joe

And each player that responds is expected to modify the thread accordingly, and plug their name in or add it to the list.  There are 20 spots, and many more on the mailing list.  Inevitably, someone always manages to botch it and confuse everyone.

And such, the 'Pick-Up Hockey' project was born.

The project is built on .NET / MVC and uses OAuth2 to allow Google logins.  Feel free to clone, fork, and pull-request away.  And feedback is very welcome.  I imagine this is a very niche use-case.  I didn't build it to be a multi-purpose platform, but I can see it evolving into something a little bigger for league / practice management or something.
